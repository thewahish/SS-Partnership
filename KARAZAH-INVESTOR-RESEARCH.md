- **Average Royalty Rate (2019):** 8.87%

**Source:** [Brand Mentiones - Licensing](https://brandmentions.com/wiki/Youtube_Brand_Deals)

## 4.3 Karazah Valuation Analysis

### Base Case: YouTube Channel Valuation

**Conservative Assumptions:**
- Subscribers: 739,000
- Views: 310M+ lifetime
- Monthly views estimate: ~5M (based on similar channels)
- Kids content RPM: $0.35 per 1,000 views
- Monthly ad revenue estimate: ~$1,750

**YouTube-Only Valuation (12-36x monthly):**
- Low: $21,000
- High: $63,000

**Note:** This dramatically undervalues the asset because:
1. Kids content is "Made for Kids" restricted (lower CPM)
2. YouTube ad revenue is a tiny fraction of total potential value
3. Ignores IP, brand, awards, expansion potential

### Adjusted Valuation: IP + Platform + Expansion

**Value Drivers:**
1. **Award-Winning Brand** - Mohammed Bin Rashid recognition
2. **Unique IP** - 3D characters with monetization potential
3. **Proven Content Library** - 732+ videos, 310M+ views
4. **Global Diaspora Reach** - Arabic-speaking families worldwide
5. **Expansion-Ready Platform** - Games, VR, merchandise, live shows
6. **Syria Market Access** - Founder's unique positioning
7. **Founder Expertise** - 25+ years, Spacetoon pedigree, Academy Award work

### Comparable-Based Valuation Scenarios

| Scenario | Comparable | Multiple | Implied Value |
|----------|------------|----------|---------------|
| Conservative | Small YouTube channels | - | $500K - $2M |
| Moderate | Blippi pre-Moonbug | - | $5M - $15M |
| Aggressive | EdTech platform (8x revenue) | - | $20M - $50M |
| Strategic | IP + Platform + Expansion | - | $50M - $100M+ |

**Key Consideration:**
CoComelon (similar 3D animated kids content) was part of Moonbug's $3B acquisition. Karazah has:
- Similar content format (3D animation, songs, education)
- Unique market position (Arabic-first, diaspora focus)
- Award recognition (Mohammed Bin Rashid)
- Smaller scale but significant growth runway
